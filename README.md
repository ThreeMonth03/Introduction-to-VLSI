# Introduction to VLSI
[The course](https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/?r=main/crsoutline&Acy=111&Sem=1&CrsNo=515119&lang=zh-tw) is offered by Lee, Chen-Yi.  
Different from the past, there are only two labs in this course.  
The other labs are in the [VLSI labs](https://timetable.nycu.edu.tw/?r=main/crsoutline&Acy=111&Sem=1&CrsNo=515173&lang=zh-tw).

# The content of 2 labs
## Lab1
